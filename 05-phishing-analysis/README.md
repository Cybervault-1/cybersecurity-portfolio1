# Phishing Analysis

## Overview
Phishing is one of the most common attack vectors in cybersecurity. 
Over 90% of successful cyberattacks begin with a phishing email. This 
section demonstrates the process of investigating suspicious emails 
reported by employees to identify whether they are malicious and 
extract all relevant indicators of compromise.

A phishing investigation in a real SOC typically involves:

- Reading the email carefully for obvious red flags
- Analysing email headers to trace the sending infrastructure
- Checking sending IPs on AbuseIPDB for reputation
- Checking links on VirusTotal without clicking them
- Extracting all IOCs for blocking and further investigation
- Advising on remediation steps
